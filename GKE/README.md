# Installing and Running the Palo Alto Networks Security Adapter for Istio 

## Installation and setup 

### Helper Scripts

Please note: I've put together some helper scripts to perform a number of the steps shown below. 
             The contents and a `README` to run those scripts can be found at: 
			 ``` https://github.com/vinayvenkat/gke_k8s_deployer ```

			 - For each step shown below, I will reference the helper script which 
 			   can potentially help simplify the process a litte bit! 


#### kubectl 

Please ensure that the `kubectl` tool in installed and available on your system. 

Instructions to install kubectl can be found at: ```https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/```

#### Install gcloud skd and tools 

Instructions to install the Google cloud SKD can be found at: ```https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install```


#### Download the kubernetes (GKE) credentials to your local system. 

 - You will need the GKE cluster name, the zone name and the project id 
 - Execute ```gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster name> --zone <zone name> --project <project name>

#### Create a kubernetes cluster role binding 

Execute the following command:

```
	kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
    --user=$(gcloud config get-value core/account)
```

#### Ensure Stackdriver Logging is enabled for the cluster

This deployement is only applicable on GKE. 

Please follow the instructions at the following to enable stack driver logging:
```https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/kubernetes-engine/legacy-stackdriver/logging```

#### Download the Istio code base if you don't have Istio already installed 

Instructions can be found at: ```https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/download-release/```

#### Setup and deploy the Istio Custom Resource Definitions 

   Note: the following paths are dependent the `pwd` directory being the directory 
         into which Istio has been deployed into. 
		 For example: ```$PWD/istio-1.0.11/```

   Execute the following command: 
   ``` kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-demo-auth.yaml ```


#### Verify the Istio installation 

 - Ensure that Istio and all its components have been successfully installed. 
 - Execute: ```kubectl get po -n istio-system```

   The output should resemble: 
   ```

## Install the Palo Alto Networks Security Adapter

Note: This assumes that you have checked out the `github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/istio` 
      repo.
      Your working directory = $PWD/istio/GKE/

Execute: ```kubectl apply -f operatorconfig```

This will install all the components required to run the Palo Alto Networks 
Security adapter on the kubernetes cluster. 

### Verify the installation of the Palo Alto Networks Adapter 


   The output should resemble: 
   ```

``` 

You will see the Palo Alto Networks security adapter's container. In this case it is: 
`panstackdriver-6789d7d88f-49tmk`


## Run some traffic to any applications deployed on your cluster


## View the logs on the Stackdriver Console on GCP

- Login to the GCP console
- Navigate to Stackdriver logging tab on the left 
- Filter to the following logs: `GKE Container -> <cluster name> -> istio-system (namespace)` 

You should be able to see the logs pertaining to intercontainer traffic on your kubernetes cluster
running with the Istio Service Mesh.
